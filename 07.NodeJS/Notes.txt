Undefined vs. undeclared variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	An undefined variable is a variable that has been declared but has not been initialized with a value.
		For example:
			let message;
			console.log(message); // undefined
			
		In this example, the message variable is declared but not initialized. 
		Therefore, the message variable is undefined
	
	In contrast, an undeclared variable is a variable that has not been declared. 
		For example:
			console.log(counter);
		Output:
			console.log(counter);
						^
			ReferenceError: counter is not defined
		In this example, the counter variable has not been declared. 
		Hence, accessing it causes a ReferenceError.

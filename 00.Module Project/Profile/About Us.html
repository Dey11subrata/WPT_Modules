      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p class="tag">
        TV Tracker is a global community of TV and movie fans tracking what
        they're watching, reacting with others and sharing the moments that move
        them.
      </p>
      <p>
        “It’s TV time … <br /><br />
        ‘Friends’ is on.” It’s that shared love of watching TV. Never missing an
        episode. Reacting to moments with tears, laughter, intrigue or general
        WTF. Sitting with others, turning to them and saying at exactly the same
        time - “Wait, what? Chandler and Rachel?” <br /><br />
        Then the world changed. Peoples watching habits became fragmented,
        different. The TV universe got bigger … and yet felt smaller at the same
        time. Mobile phones, tablets and other devices allowed us to watch from
        anywhere. Entire series were released in a day. 10 channels became
        1,000. TV just kept getting better, and bigger, and better. And more
        than ever, we wanted to stay on top of our favorite shows. We got
        enraged when anyone even hinted at a spoiler. And finding our tribes,
        those like us, to share moments and react to, at the moment we felt it,
        became so vital, so enriching, so core to our daily routines.
        <br /><br />
        And so we created our own multi-platform, virtual TV tracking community
        of millions so that we’d never lose, only grow, that emotional pull we
        shared and loved when we first heard those words - “It’s TV Time …
        ‘Friends’ is on.”
